# DevOps_Project

I created this project in order to familiarize myself with some of the most used technologies in DevOps. 

The main characteristics are as it follows:<br/>
-Simple Hello World Node application<br/>
-Docker to containerize the application, and create an environment with all requisites the application requires to run<br/>
-Kubernetes to distribute the docker image<br/>
-Terraform to create the infrastruture as code<br/>
-AWS as cloud provider<br/>
