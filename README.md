# DevOps_Project_Version1

I created this project in order to familiarize myself with some of the most used technologies in DevOps. 

The main characteristics are as it follows:
-Simple Hello World Node application
-Docker to containerize the application, and create an environment with all requisites the application requires to run
-Kubernetes to distribute the docker image
-Terraform to create the infrastruture as code
-AWS as cloud provider
